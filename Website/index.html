    <b> Education </b>
  </div>

  <div>
    Elementary School - P.S. 31
  </div>


  <div>
    Middle School - I.S 318 Eugenio Maria De Hostos
  </div>

    <div>
      High School - The Beacon High School
    </div>
</p>

<p>
These are the schools I have attended during my early educational life. In each, I have participated in a variety of clubs and extracurricular activities.
During my time at P.S. 31, I was a part of the guitar club since 3rd grade and cheerleading since 4th till I graduated.
In I.S. 318, I was a part of the concert band since the summer after P.S. 31 and later joined the marching band for one year.
In concert band, I was 1st seat flute and piccolo. Being a part of the band was a tremendous commitment which required an intense amount of discipline, precision, and teamwork.
Then I auditioned for a Borough Wide concert band and played for the borough of Queens for two years. Over the course of my involvement in band, many concerts were held to present the pieces we have rehearsed.
Chamber groups, solos, and the jazz band were also segments of our performance our audience looked forward to. Thankfully, during my 1st year with the Queens Borough concert band, we got to perform at Carnegie Hall.
